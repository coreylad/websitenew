<p class="marginConstant"> Not a Windows or Winamp user? Don\'t worry, we\'ve got you covered! For our advanced users on Mac OS X, Linux and Unix, the UNIX/Linux version of the SHOUTcast Radio DSP permits input from a soundcard in addition to MP3 files on disk. Please refer to the example .conf file included with the archive for more information. Please note that this method of broadcasting is currently in beta and therefore unsupported. Please use at your own risk.
